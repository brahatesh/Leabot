# Leabot
A bot with leave management functionality where an employee can apply for sick/paid leave and a manager can accept or reject the request for leave.

To install the required libraries, run the following command in the root directory of the bot:
```bash
pip -r install requirements.txt
```
To start the app (backend for the bot), run the following command:
```bash
python ap.py
```

After adding the bot first, use '.help' to see a list of commands and to see help for a particular command, use the command '.help <command>'.

To register yourself, use the command '.register'. You can also apply for leaves using '.leave'.
